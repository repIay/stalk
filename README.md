make sure valo is open BEFORE loading. wait 4 the game to start n then names will start printing and being checked. make sure to adjust your settings.json file to your preferences. you can open this file in any text editor (e.g notepad++).

settings.json:

- stateInterval: int. change for faster or slower delays between gamestate loop (slower = less CPU usage. faster = more CPU usage)

- twitchReqDelay: int. the delay for the request checking if a streamer is live. If you are getting ratelimited, make this slower. if you want faster loading times, make this faster.

- skipTeamPlayers: boolean. decide whether or not you want to skip team members during the process of checking possible twitch names.

- skipPartyPlayers: boolean. decide whether or not you want to skip party members during the process of checking possible twitch names.

- use @ your own risk. with all programs like thi, there is no guarantee that it's safe because using the VALORANT API in this manner is against riot's terms of service. no suspensions have been reported so far from using this program. with all things considered, i would use this only on an alt account if you don't want to risk the API abuse account suspension on your main, albeit unlikely.
